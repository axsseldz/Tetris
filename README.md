# Tetris

                                                    ~ DESCRIPTION ~

We recreate the Tetris game by adding new features using MiniWin which is a mini library that provides us with functions to open a window, paint on it and detect the pressure of some keys, which helps us to develop basic games.


                                                    ~ FEATURES ~

• Rotate
    the pieces can rotate using the keys.

• Move pieces
    player can move the pieces to the sides and choose where they will land.

• Lowering speed
    pieces go down with a certain speed depending on the level in which the player is, but they can be accelerated with the key.

• Complete a row
    when completing a row, that row is destroyed, you add 1 point.

• Level up
    the moment you accumulate 5 points automatically you level up and the speed increases.

• Pause the game
    with the space bar key you can pause the game and rotate the piece but this can only be done 3 times.
